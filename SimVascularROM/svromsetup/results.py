"""What a 0D solution says at each cap, and along the centerlines it was built on.

svZeroDSolver reports per *vessel*: the flow and pressure at both ends of every segment of
every branch. What anyone asks of a result is per *face* -- what is the pressure at the RPA,
how much of the venous return goes left -- and where on the anatomy, so this reads the solver
input beside the results to say which vessel end each cap is, and maps the vessels back onto
the centerlines they were cut from.

The sign of a flow is turned to mean the same thing at every cap: positive in the direction its
condition drives it, into the model at an inflow and out of it at an outlet. svZeroDSolver
counts flow down each vessel, so at an inflow prescribed on a vessel's outlet end -- every
inflow but the inlet's, since the centerlines run from the inlet -- its own number is negative.
