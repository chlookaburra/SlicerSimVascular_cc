"""Every setting a rigid-wall CFD `solver.xml` is written with, its default, and how it is read.

**One table, and the defaults in it are the only ones.** Every value the writer puts in a
`solver.xml` other than the mesh and the boundary conditions is a row here: what the panel draws
a field for, what it starts that field at, and what turns what was typed into what is written.
There is no second default anywhere -- not in the panel, not in the writer, not left to
svMultiPhysics -- so changing a default is changing one line here, and a `solver.xml` says every
value it was run with rather than leaving some to whichever svMultiPhysics read it.

**Where the defaults come from.** The linear solver's, the time stepping's and the saving's are
the lab's for rigid-wall CFD: 10000 steps of 1 ms, saving results and restarts every 100 steps
from the first. The rest are, for now, the Fontan workflow's `solver_template.xml`
(ClinicalWorkflows), less its scalar-transport equation: a template that has run every Fontan
case, standing in until the defaults meant for this panel replace it.

**Why every value goes through `parse`.** svMultiPhysics reads a number with `istringstream`,
which takes the longest numeric prefix and drops the rest without a word: `1,5e-4` is read as
`1`, `0.04P` as `0.04`. So nothing typed is written as typed. It is parsed here into a number
of the setting's kind, refused if it is not one, and written from the number.
