"""The 0D model as the network it is: what is joined to what, and what each block holds.

svZeroDSolver's input is three lists -- vessels, junctions, boundary conditions -- joined by name
and number, and its results are a row per vessel per time point. Neither shows the model. This
reads the input as a directed graph, a node for every condition, vessel segment and junction and
an edge for every connection, and lays it out in layers from the source, for a panel to draw.

The layout is worked out here rather than by Graphviz, which svZeroDVisualization draws with.
Graphviz is a program, not a Python package, so pip cannot install it, and without it that
application shows nothing; and a network traced along centerlines is a tree, which a layered
layout draws as clearly as anything general would.

Edges run the way the model was traced, from the source outwards, which is not always the way
the blood goes: an inflow prescribed at a centerline's far end -- a Fontan's hepatic veins -- is
an edge out of the model with the flow coming in, which is what the sign of its condition says
(see `results`).
