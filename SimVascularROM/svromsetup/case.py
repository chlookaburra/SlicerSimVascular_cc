"""The case folder a 0D simulation is set up and run in, written through `sv_rom_simulation`.

`sv_rom_simulation` turns a surface whose faces carry a `ModelFaceID` into an svZeroDSolver
input file: centerlines from VMTK, split into branches, each branch a chain of vessels whose
resistance, inductance and capacitance come from the centerline's section areas, and the
caps' boundary conditions at the ends. What it reads is files -- the surface, the face files,
SimVascular's boundary condition files -- so this writes them, calls it, and checks what it
wrote.

```
case/
  mesh-complete/                the faces, as SimVascular Mesh Prep's Export writes them
    mesh-complete.exterior.vtp    the surface the centerlines are traced inside
    mesh-surfaces/<name>.vtp      one file per face, named, which is what names the outlets
  centerlines.vtp               branch-split centerlines
  inflow.flow                   the inlet's flow
  flow.dat, <name>.flow         the other inflows, prescribed at their centerline ends
  rcrt.dat, resistance.dat      the outlets
  solver_0d.json                svZeroDSolver's input
  results.csv                   svZeroDSolver's output
```

The face files are the same `mesh-complete` folder a 3D case of the same mesh uses, so a 0D
and a 3D simulation of one anatomy name every face the same way, and the 0D one can be kept
beside the other.

`sv_rom_simulation` is imported where it is called rather than at the top, because it imports
VMTK and VMTK is not a dependency of anything else here: under Slicer it is SlicerVMTK's, and
the panel has to make it importable first.
