# SimVascular ROM Simulation

## Summary

Sets up a 0D (reduced-order) blood flow simulation of a vascular model whose faces are named
in [SimVascular Mesh Prep](SimVascularMeshPrep.md), runs it with
[svZeroDSolver](https://github.com/SimVascular/svZeroDSolver), and shows the results in the
scene. You give one boundary condition per cap and pick the source; the module traces
centerlines from the source with [SlicerVMTK](https://github.com/vmtk/SlicerExtension-VMTK),
builds the 0D model along them with [svromutils](https://pypi.org/project/svromutils/),
writes the svZeroDSolver input file, runs the solver, and reads the CSV back.

A 0D model replaces the three-dimensional flow with a network: each vessel segment becomes a
resistance, an inductance and a capacitance worked out from its length and cross-section. It
solves in well under a second, which makes it the model to tune boundary conditions on, or to
check a 3D case against before running it.

The results come back three ways: the pressure over the last cardiac cycle of the caps you
select, in Slicer's plot view; the centerlines drawn inside the anatomy, coloured by
cycle-averaged pressure; and a CSV of every cap's flow and pressure, exported from the panel.
All three are in Slicer itself, and nothing has to be installed for them.

## Tutorial

1. **Name the faces.** Open the mesh in SimVascular Mesh Prep. A mesh out of Clip Vessel
   arrives named after its clip points, and opening it there is enough to save those names on
   it. Caps are the faces named `cap_*`; the wall is `wall` or `wall_*`.
2. **Open SimVascular ROM Simulation** and select the mesh in **Labelled mesh**. This can be the
   volume mesh CFD Mesh Generator made, or a labelled surface, since a 0D model needs only the
   surface. The **Boundary conditions** table lists the caps, and selecting a row highlights
   that cap in the 3D view.
3. **Give every cap a condition.** Choose its kind in the **Type** column, then fill in
   **Values**; the hint below the table gives the order.
   - **Inflow**: double-click the values to load a waveform from a `.flow` file; the cell then
     shows that file's path. For a steady flow instead, select the cell and type `Q`. The
     waveform itself is saved with the scene, so moving or deleting the file later does not
     change the condition.
   - **RCR**: double-click and type `Rp, C, Rd, Pd`, i.e. proximal resistance, compliance,
     distal resistance and distal pressure. `Pd` can be left out, and is then 0.
   - **Resistance**: double-click and type `R`. A resistance drains to zero pressure and has no
     distal pressure, as svMultiPhysics' Resistance condition has none and the same conditions
     are written for the 3D solver; an outlet that needs a pressure to drain to is an RCR.

   Values are in cgs units: flow in mL/s, resistance in dyn·s/cm⁵, compliance in cm⁵/dyn,
   pressure in dyn/cm² (1 mmHg = 1333.22 dyn/cm²). A value that cannot be read is shown in
   red; hover over it to see why.
4. **Choose the source** in the **Centerlines** section. The centerlines are traced from this
   cap, and it needs an inflow; the largest cap is suggested. On a model with several inflows
   any of them will do: the other inflows are prescribed where their own centerlines end, and
   the answer does not depend on which one is the source. **Compute centerlines** (optional)
   shows the branch-split centerlines, so you can check that every cap was reached. Running the
   simulation computes them if they are not up to date.
5. **Set up the simulation.** Choose an **Output folder**; by default it is `rom/<mesh>` next to the
   saved scene. Check the blood density and viscosity, and the number of **Cardiac cycles** and
   **Time points per cycle**. Only the last cycle is reported, so the cycles before it give the
   compliances time to settle. The mesh is taken to be in millimetres, which is what Slicer's
   coordinates are, and is scaled to the solver's centimetres on the way.
6. **Create solver files** (optional) writes the boundary condition files and svZeroDSolver's
   `solver_0d.json` into the output folder without running anything, computing the
   centerlines first if they are not current. Look at them, or change `solver_0d.json` by hand.
7. **Run simulation.** This runs svZeroDSolver on the solver files as they are, so an edit made by
   hand since creating them is what gets solved. The files are created first if they are not
   there, or if anything in the panel has changed since they were. The status line reports the
   total flow in and out over the last cycle, which should match. Select caps in the
   **Boundary conditions** table to plot them (the source is plotted when nothing is selected);
   the centerlines in the 3D view are coloured by cycle-averaged pressure. The results model also carries the flow, which the Models module can
   colour it by instead. **Export results** writes a CSV of every cap's flow and pressure over
   the last cycle: a time column, then a flow (mL/s) and a pressure (mmHg) column per cap. Flow
   is positive the way the cap's condition drives it, into the model at an inflow and out of it
   at an outlet.

The conditions and the source are saved on the mesh, so they come back when you reopen the
scene, and two anatomies in one scene keep separate conditions. The conditions are shared with
[SimVascular MultiPhysics](SimVascularMultiPhysics.md): set in either panel, they are the ones
both write, so a 0D model tuned here is the 3D case written there. An output folder that already
holds results shows them again when the mesh is selected.

### What gets written

```
<output folder>/
  mesh-complete/                the faces, as Mesh Prep's Export writes them
    mesh-complete.exterior.vtp
    mesh-surfaces/cap_*.vtp
  centerlines.vtp               branch-split centerlines
  inflow.flow                   the source's flow
  flow.dat, cap_*.flow          the other inflows
  rcrt.dat, resistance.dat      the outlets
  solver_0d.json                svZeroDSolver's input
  branch_results.csv            svZeroDSolver's output, per vessel segment
  cap_results.csv               Export results' suggestion: the same results, per cap
```

The boundary conditions in `solver_0d.json` are named after their faces (`RCR_cap_lpa_a`,
`FLOW_cap_azygous_vein`), except the source's, which is `INFLOW`. The solver's results are per
vessel segment, named `branch<b>_seg<s>`, which is why their file is `branch_results.csv`; the
panel works out which vessel end each cap is, and **Export results** writes the same results by
cap name, suggested as `cap_results.csv` beside it.

### Several inflows

A Fontan has the venae cavae, the azygous and the hepatic veins all entering, and the pulmonary
arteries all leaving. The centerlines run from the source, so every other inflow sits at a
centerline *end*. There it is prescribed as a flow entering the model. The resistances and
junctions of a 0D network do not care which way flow goes, so this is the same model as one
drawn from any other inflow.

Every inflow has to cover the same cardiac cycle. A steady inflow is spread over the period of
the waveforms next to it.

### Flow files and their sign

A `.flow` file is a time and a flow on each line, over one cycle starting at 0. Here an inflow
is positive. A file written for svMultiPhysics gives inflow as *negative*, because its flow is
measured along the outward normal. A loaded waveform whose mean is negative is therefore turned
round, and the status line says so.

## Setting up

Install **SlicerVMTK** from the Extensions Manager.

[svromutils](https://pypi.org/project/svromutils/), which builds the 0D model, needs no setting
up: the first time you compute centerlines or create solver files, Slicer asks to install it from
PyPI, and does. It is installed *without* the packages it says it depends on, all of which Slicer
has already (see [svromutils under Slicer](#svromutils-under-slicer)). **Do not**
`pip_install("svromutils")` into Slicer by hand: that installs them all over Slicer's own. If you
need to install it yourself, `slicer.util.pip_install("--no-deps svromutils")` in the Python
console is the same thing.

svZeroDSolver needs no setting up either. It is
[svzerod](https://pypi.org/project/svzerod/) on PyPI, and the first time you run a simulation,
Slicer asks to install it, with everything it asks for. It comes as prebuilt wheels for every
platform, so nothing is compiled, and nothing it brings replaces anything of Slicer's. By hand,
it is `slicer.util.pip_install("svzerod")`. A build of svZeroDSolver of your own, or one on the
PATH, is not used: see [Why the solver is a process](#why-the-solver-is-a-process).

Nothing else is needed: the panel has no paths to set.

## Developers

### The split

`SimVascularROM.py` is an MRML adapter over `svromsetup`, the package beside it, which imports
nothing from Slicer: the conditions and SimVascular's files for them, the case folder, the calls
into `svromutils` and the checks on what it wrote, the solver run, and the results read
back. A case set up from a terminal calls the same functions:

```python
from svromsetup import case, solver, results
from svromsetup.boundary_conditions import Inflow, Resistance

case.write_surfaces(volume_mesh, names, "case")             # {face id: name}, as Mesh Prep saves them
case.compute_centerlines("case", inlet_face_id=3)
config = case.write_solver_input("case", {"cap_RSVC": Inflow.steady(20.0), ...}, 3, "cap_RSVC",
                                 case.SimulationParameters(), "fontan")
solver.run_solver(config, "case/branch_results.csv", solver.find_solver())  # pip install svzerod
faces = results.face_results(config, solver.read_results("case/branch_results.csv"), "cap_RSVC")
results.write_face_results_csv("case/cap_results.csv", faces)
```

`svromutils` is imported only inside the two functions that call it, because it imports
VMTK. Everything else in `svromsetup` needs only numpy and VTK, and so do its tests.

### svromutils under Slicer

`svromutils` is installed with `slicer.packaging.pip_ensure`, asked to skip `vmtk`, `vtk`, `numpy`
and `scipy` (`ROM_PACKAGE_SKIPPED_DEPENDENCIES`). Each would break Slicer if pip installed it:

- **vmtk** pins a VTK of its own (`vtk==9.6.2` for 1.5.2), and a second VTK over Slicer's breaks
  the application.
- **vtk** *is* that second VTK.
- **numpy and scipy**: svromutils 0.1.2 asks for `numpy>=2.5` and `scipy>=1.18`, newer than the
  numpy 2.4 and scipy 1.17 in Slicer 5.12. pip would replace them, under every extension built
  against the old ones. What svromutils uses of them works with Slicer's own.

Skipping them installs svromutils with `--no-deps`, and removes them from its installed metadata,
so that a later `pip install` of something else does not go back and install them. The rejected
alternative was a plain `pip_ensure("svromutils")` with a constraints file pinning Slicer's own
versions. That fails outright: pip cannot satisfy `numpy>=2.5` and `numpy==2.4.*` together, and
vmtk's VTK pin conflicts with any constraint.

If the package ever declares these as optional (an extra, say `svromutils[vmtk]`), the skip list
can go.

### VMTK under Slicer

`svromutils` imports `from vmtk import vtkvmtk`, which is how pip's VMTK is laid out, and pip's
VMTK is not installed (above). SlicerVMTK carries the same
classes in modules of its own (`vtkvmtkComputationalGeometryPython`, …). So the panel assembles
a `vmtk.vtkvmtk` module out of them before importing the package (`ensureVmtk`). The branch
splitting the package relies on, `vtkvmtkPolyDataCenterlineBranchSplitting`, has been in
SlicerVMTK's VMTK since the update of September 2026.

### Why the solver is a process

svZeroDSolver is installed into Slicer's Python as `svzerod`, but not imported there. It runs as
the `svzerodsolver` command the package installs, in a process of its own. It is C++, and a
model it cannot handle is not always an exception. The released wheels compile its assertions
out, so an inconsistent model reaches Eigen unchecked. Its command line also ends in C's
`exit()` when it is called wrongly. Either one, in-process, would take Slicer and an unsaved
scene with it. A 0D model solves in well under a second, so the round trip through files costs
nothing.

The command is looked for where pip put it, in the scripts folder beside Slicer's Python
(`sysconfig.get_path("scripts")`), and never on the PATH. It runs with Slicer's own environment,
because it is Slicer's Python that runs it. Slicer's launcher points `PYTHONHOME`, `PYTHONPATH`
and the library path at Slicer's Python, which is right for that command and wrong for any other
Python's. A `svzerodsolver` found on the PATH belongs to another Python, such as a conda
environment's, so run with Slicer's environment it would start on Slicer's.

The rejected alternative was keeping the **svzerodsolver** path under Tools, for a build of
svZeroDSolver of your own. Every machine needed one, and the wheel makes it unnecessary.
A terminal workflow can still pass any executable to `run_solver`.

### Against svZeroDVisualization, for now

The panel used to have a **Visualize results** button. It opened svZeroDSolver's
[svZeroDVisualization](https://simvascular.github.io/documentation/rom_simulation.html#0d-solver-visualization),
a Dash web application that draws the 0D network as a graph in the browser, with each block's
parameters and results a click away. It was removed because it was the one thing in the panel
that had to be installed by hand, and in three places:

- **A checkout of svZeroDSolver.** The application is not in the `svzerod` wheel.
- **A Python environment of its own**, with `svzerod`, `dash`, `plotly`, `pandas`, `networkx`
  and `pydot`.
- **Graphviz.** The graph is laid out by Graphviz's `dot` program, which is not a Python package
  and which pip cannot install. A machine without it never shows the page; the reason is only in
  the application's log.

Two ways to keep it were rejected:

- **Bundling its scripts here and running them on Slicer's Python.** The panel would install
  dash, plotly, networkx and pydot into Slicer, 22 packages in all. That removes the checkout
  and the environment, but not Graphviz without patching the layout. It also leaves a copy of
  another project's code to keep in step by hand, and runs a web server to draw one graph.
- **Keeping it as an optional extra.** That means a button that works only on machines that have
  all three, and fails on the rest with nothing in the panel to say why.

The three views above cover what a 0D run is set up to find. They are the caps' pressures over
the cycle, the pressure along every branch, and every cap's flow and pressure to take away.
What is lost is the network graph, and the results of a vessel that does not end at a cap. If
the second is missed, it belongs in the panel: pick a vessel on the centerlines, and plot its
flow and pressure in Slicer's own plot view. The first can come back once svZeroDVisualization
is installable from PyPI with everything it needs.

### Outlets paired by position

The package matches outlet names to boundary conditions by list position. Nothing ties the
order of the centerline ends to the order of the caps, and an off-by-one list puts every
condition on its neighbour's vessel, with all the ids still valid. So the centerline ends are
paired with the cap files by where they are: one to one, closest first, and refused if an end
is further than a cap's width from its cap. `check_solver_input` then holds the written file to
what was asked: one condition per cap, on one vessel end, of the right kind, over the requested
cycles.

### Tests

The package's tests are headless (pytest, from `SimVascularROM/`):

```sh
python -m pip install svromutils svzerod  # outside Slicer, where pip's VMTK and VTK are what you want
python -m pytest
```

The solver is found beside that Python, whether or not its environment is activated. To test a
build of svZeroDSolver of your own instead, set `SVZERODSOLVER=/path/to/svzerodsolver`.

`svromsetup.testing` builds a capped Y, with arms of different radii so that its two outlets can
be told apart by their results. The tests that need `svromutils` (and VMTK) or the solver
skip themselves where these are missing; with only numpy, VTK and pytest, 26 run. The module's
own tests (`SimVascularROMTest`) run under Slicer: they check that conditions are kept per mesh,
that an unnamed mesh is sent to Mesh Prep, and a whole case on the Y. A `--testing` run loads
none of the installed extensions, so pass SlicerVMTK's module folders as
`--additional-module-paths`, along with `SimVascularMeshPrep` and `SimVascularROM`.
